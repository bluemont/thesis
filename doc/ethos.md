# Ethos

This design document lays out the Thesis 'ethos', which flows from the project
goals. It aims to provide a long-term 'feel'.

## Encourage consistency across modes

For example, code folding in one language should work like folding in another
language or even outline mode.

## Encourage standard UI Patterns

For example, Thesis should encourage the use of common UI elements, such as
lists, trees, tabs, and so on.

## Prefer a golden-path

Emacs is great in that it is extremely customizable. However, this does fragment
the community. I'd rather not have 10 ways to do autocompletion, for
example. I'd prefer that Thesis, as a community, try to keep 80% of functionality
on a golden path. I think this will lead to a better user experience.

I don't mind experimentation, but if I (or someone else) serves as a curator,
then I think such a role involves leadership as to what makes it into the core.
